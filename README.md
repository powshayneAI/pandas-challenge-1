# pandas-challenge-1

For this challenge, we were tasked with analyzing and summarizing data provided 
by client_dataset.csv using Pandas as the programming language.

Through this, we were tasked with creating dataframes, as well as editing the 
the output.

In these dataframes we:
- rearranged the columns
- renamed columns
- created new columns
    - created columns by adding columns together

We were also tasked with identifying the top five clients (clients that had ordered the most)
and had to find the sum of all revenue, costs, and profits for said clients.

As a side note, I originally had trouble withg getting the correct outcomes for the calculations.
However, through many minutes and days of trying to figure out the issue, I determined
the cause of such difficulties were due to the fact I had already done the calculations in part 1
and only had to use the '.sum()' commad on specific columns from the dataframe.
